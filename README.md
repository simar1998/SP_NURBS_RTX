Non-Planar 3D Printing: GCode Generation with Ray Tracing, Data Science, and NURBS
3D-Printing

This project aims to revolutionize 3D printing technology by generating non-planar GCode using ray tracing, data science, and Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) techniques. Unlike conventional 3D printing, which utilizes planar layers, our approach creates smooth, curved layers, resulting in a higher-quality 3D print with better surface finishing and increased structural integrity.
